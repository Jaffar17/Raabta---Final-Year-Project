## What is Raabta?

As part of our Final Year Project in our undergrad studies in Computer Science, we made a mental health wellness platform, named Raabta, which aims to provide solutions to the prevailing mental health problems in Pakistan. Raabta connects normal users (like us) to the mental health experts (counsellors) and brings value through its features like Personality Test, Emotion Detection Model, Live Chat, and Add Notes, which makes the work of counsellors easier than what they currently experience in the existing mental health platforms in Pakistan.


## Tech Stack

Our mobile app is based on Flutter and relies on Firebase for its database and backend services. For the emotion detection model, we have used Python and deployed it using Flask API.
